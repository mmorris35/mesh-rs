# MESH Security Model

> **Secure as fuck** — The guiding principle

## Threat Model

### Adversaries

| Adversary | Capabilities | Goals |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Passive Network Observer** | Can see traffic metadata | Learn who shares what with whom |
| **Active Network Attacker** | Can intercept/modify traffic | Inject false lessons, impersonate nodes |
| **Malicious Node** | Controls one or more MESH nodes | Poison knowledge base, spam, harvest data |
| **Compromised Directory** | Controls a directory server | Censor nodes, manipulate discovery |
| **Rogue Insider** | Has legitimate access to a node | Leak private lessons, forge attributions |

### Assets to Protect

1. **Private Records** — Lessons and checkpoints must never leak without explicit publish action
2. **Node Identity** — Must not be impersonatable
3. **Record Integrity** — Content must not be tamperable
4. **Attribution** — Publisher must be verifiable
5. **Revocation** — Unpublished content must become unavailable
6. **Query Privacy** — What you search for reveals interests
7. **Social Graph** — Who trusts whom is sensitive

---

## Cryptographic Primitives

### Identity

Each MESH node has a **long-term identity keypair**:

```
Algorithm: Ed25519
Private key: 32 bytes, never leaves the node
Public key: 32 bytes, serves as node identifier
Fingerprint: SHA-256(public_key), displayed as hex
```

**Node ID** = Base58 encoding of public key (like IPFS peer IDs)

Example: `12D3KooWN7hT5qJK4vZ9kE3xP2yR8mF6wL1cD4nB2aS5gH7jU9iY`

### Record Signing

Every shared record (lesson or checkpoint) includes a cryptographic signature. The structure is identical for both record types:

```typescript
interface SignedLesson {
  // Original AMP lesson (may include implementation-specific fields)
  lesson: Lesson;

  // Publication metadata
  publication: {
    visibility: "unlisted" | "public";
    publishedAt: number;
    topics?: string[];
  };

  // Cryptographic signature
  signature: {
    algorithm: "ed25519";
    nodeId: string;         // Publisher's node ID
    publicKey: string;      // Base64 Ed25519 public key
    timestamp: number;      // Signing timestamp (Unix ms)
    sig: string;            // Base64 signature
  };
}

interface SignedCheckpoint {
  // Same structure, substituting checkpoint for lesson
  checkpoint: Checkpoint;
  publication: { /* same as above */ };
  signature: { /* same as above */ };
}
```

**Signing process:**
1. Construct payload: `{ lesson|checkpoint, publication, timestamp }`
2. Canonicalize JSON (RFC 8785: sorted keys, no whitespace)
3. Sign canonical bytes with Ed25519 private key
4. Attach signature block to produce signed record

**Verification process:**
1. Extract record (`lesson` or `checkpoint`), `publication`, and `signature.timestamp`
2. Reconstruct canonical payload
3. Verify Ed25519 signature against payload using `signature.publicKey`
4. Verify `signature.nodeId` matches `base58(signature.publicKey)`
5. Check timestamp is within acceptable window
6. Optionally verify trust path to signer

### Transport Security

All MESH communication uses **TLS 1.3** minimum.

```
Required cipher suites:
- TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

Certificate validation:
- Standard PKI for initial connection
- Node identity verified via signed challenge after TLS established
```

### Optional: End-to-End Encryption

For sensitive sync between trusted nodes (not public sharing):

```
Algorithm: X25519 key exchange + XChaCha20-Poly1305
Forward secrecy: New ephemeral keypair per session
```

---

## Visibility Levels

| Level | Who can see | Indexed by directories | Appears in federated search |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| `private` | Only you | No | No |
| `unlisted` | Anyone with direct link | No | No |
| `public` | Everyone | Yes | Yes |

**Transitions:**
- `private` → `public`: Publish action (signs and announces)
- `public` → `private`: Revoke action (signs and propagates revocation)
- `unlisted`: Middle ground for sharing via direct link without broadcast

---

## Revocation

When a record is unpublished:

```typescript
interface RevocationRecord {
  recordType: "lesson" | "checkpoint";
  recordId: string;         // ID of the lesson or checkpoint
  revokedAt: number;        // Unix ms
  reason?: string;          // Optional: "outdated", "incorrect", "private"
  signature: {
    algorithm: "ed25519";
    nodeId: string;         // Must match original publisher
    publicKey: string;
    sig: string;
  };
}
```

**Revocation propagation:**
1. Author signs revocation record
2. Sends to all known peers
3. Peers verify signature matches original record publisher
4. Peers delete cached copies, propagate revocation
5. Directories remove from index

**Revocation is best-effort.** Once something is public, copies may exist. Revocation signals intent and compliant nodes will honor it.

---

## Trust Model

### Web of Trust

Nodes don't trust a central authority. Instead:

```
Direct trust:     You explicitly mark a node as trusted
Transitive trust: If you trust A, and A trusts B, you have a path to B
Trust depth:      How many hops you'll traverse (default: 2)
Trust score:      Decays with distance: 1.0 → 0.5 → 0.25
```

### Trust Operations

```bash
mesh trust add nodeB --level full        # Direct trust
mesh trust add nodeC --level limited     # Trust for search, not sync
mesh trust remove nodeD                  # Revoke trust
mesh trust list                          # Show trust graph
```

### Trust Verification

Before accepting a record (lesson or checkpoint) from the network:

1. **Signature valid?** — Ed25519 verification passes
2. **Publisher trusted?** — Direct or transitive trust path exists
3. **Not revoked?** — No valid revocation record seen
4. **Timestamp sane?** — Within acceptable window

Records failing verification are **rejected**, not stored.

---

## Directory Security

Directories are **untrusted conveniences**, not authorities.

### What Directories Can Do
- Index public records (lessons and checkpoints)
- Return search results
- Provide node discovery

### What Directories Cannot Do
- Forge records (no private keys)
- Modify content (signatures break)
- Hide revocations (nodes gossip directly too)
- Compel trust (trust is node-to-node)

### Directory Federation

Multiple directories exist. Nodes can:
- Query multiple directories
- Run their own directory
- Operate without any directory (peer-to-peer only)

```bash
mesh directory add https://dir.example.com
mesh directory add https://amp-directory.org
mesh directory list
mesh directory remove https://evil.example.com
```

### Directory Accountability

Directories sign their responses. Misbehavior is provable:

```typescript
interface DirectoryResponse {
  results: SignedLesson[];
  directory: {
    nodeId: string;
    timestamp: number;
    signature: string;    // Directory signs the response
  };
}
```

If a directory returns forged results, the forgery is cryptographically evident.

---

## Query Privacy

### The Problem
Your searches reveal your interests. "How to fix vulnerability X" tells observers you might have vulnerability X.

### Mitigations

**Level 1: TLS**
- Passive observers see you talking to nodes, not what you're asking
- Baseline, always on

**Level 2: Query Fanout**
- Query multiple nodes with different query fragments
- Combine results locally
- Observers see multiple partial queries

**Level 3: Private Information Retrieval (Future)**
- Cryptographic PIR allows queries without revealing the query
- Computationally expensive, optional for sensitive searches

### Metadata Minimization

MESH nodes should:
- Not log queries by default
- Not require authentication for public searches
- Support Tor/I2P for network-level anonymity

---

## Attack Scenarios & Mitigations

### 1. Impersonation Attack
**Attack:** Mallory claims to be Alice's node.
**Mitigation:** All messages signed with Ed25519. Mallory can't forge Alice's signature.

### 2. Replay Attack
**Attack:** Mallory captures a valid signed record, replays it later.
**Mitigation:** Timestamps in signatures. Nodes reject stale timestamps.

### 3. Sybil Attack
**Attack:** Mallory creates 1000 fake nodes to dominate the network.
**Mitigation:** Web of trust. Fake nodes have no trust paths to real users.

### 4. Poisoning Attack
**Attack:** Mallory publishes plausible but wrong records.
**Mitigation:** Attribution is permanent. Reputation tracks accuracy. Block bad actors.

### 5. Eclipse Attack
**Attack:** Mallory isolates a node from the real network.
**Mitigation:** Multiple directory sources. Direct peer connections. Out-of-band verification.

### 6. Censorship Attack
**Attack:** Compromised directory hides certain records.
**Mitigation:** Multiple directories. Direct peer gossip. Anyone can run a directory.

### 7. Harvest Now, Decrypt Later
**Attack:** Record encrypted traffic, break crypto in future.
**Mitigation:** Forward secrecy (ephemeral keys). Public records are signed, not encrypted—public content isn't secret.

## Cryptographic Revocation (Hard Delete)

Standard revocation is best-effort: compliant nodes honor it, but copies may persist. **Cryptographic revocation** makes content mathematically inaccessible.

### Principle

> The content never leaves your control. Only encrypted forms are shared. You hold the key. Revoke the key, and all copies become permanent noise.

### Architecture

```
Publishing:
  Record (lesson or checkpoint) ─► AES-256-GCM encrypt ─► Encrypted blob (shared)
                                          │
                                          └─► Symmetric key (kept on your node)

Reading:
  Encrypted blob + Key fetch from author ─► Decrypted record

Revoking:
  Delete key ─► All encrypted blobs become unreadable
```

### Encrypted Record Format

```typescript
interface EncryptedRecord {
  // Encryption metadata
  encryption: {
    algorithm: "aes-256-gcm";
    keyId: string;              // Unique key identifier
    keyEndpoint: string;        // URL to fetch key
    nonce: string;              // Base64, 12 bytes for GCM
    tag: string;                // Base64, GCM auth tag
  };
  
  // The encrypted content
  ciphertext: string;           // Base64 encrypted record JSON
  
  // Signature covers the encrypted form
  signature: {
    algorithm: "ed25519";
    nodeId: string;
    publicKey: string;
    timestamp: number;
    sig: string;
  };
}
```

### Key Management

Keys are served by the author's node:

```
GET /mesh/v1/keys/{keyId}
```

Response (if authorized and not revoked):
```json
{
  "keyId": "key_abc123",
  "key": "base64_encoded_aes_key",
  "expiresAt": 1710000000000
}
```

Response (if revoked):
```json
{
  "error": "KEY_REVOKED",
  "revokedAt": 1707235200000
}
```

### Authorization for Key Access

Keys can be restricted:

```typescript
interface KeyPolicy {
  keyId: string;
  access: "public" | "trusted" | "explicit";
  allowedNodes?: string[];      // For explicit access
  minTrustScore?: number;       // For trusted access
}
```

- `public`: Any node can fetch the key
- `trusted`: Only nodes in your trust graph
- `explicit`: Only specifically listed nodes

### Revocation Process

```bash
mesh revoke lesson_abc123 --hard
```

This:
1. Deletes the key from local storage
2. Marks the keyId as revoked (returns KEY_REVOKED forever)
3. Propagates standard revocation record to network
4. Content is now cryptographically dead

### Key Escrow (Optional)

For availability when your node is offline, keys can be escrowed:

```typescript
interface KeyEscrow {
  keyId: string;
  escrowNodes: string[];        // Trusted nodes holding backup
  threshold: number;            // k-of-n required to reconstruct
  encryptedShares: string[];    // Shamir secret sharing
}
```

Revocation must notify escrow nodes to delete their shares.

### Caching Considerations

Nodes MAY cache decrypted content in memory for performance. To limit exposure:

1. **TTL on decrypted cache**: Re-fetch key periodically
2. **Revocation push**: Author can push revocation to known readers
3. **Key rotation**: Periodically rotate keys for long-lived content

### Guarantees

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Compliant node, revoked | Deletes cached content, key fetch fails |
| Non-compliant node, revoked | Has encrypted blob, key fetch fails, content unreadable |
| Offline/archived copy | Encrypted blob is permanent noise |
| Backup restored | Key still revoked, content still dead |

### Limitations

- **RAM snapshots**: If content was decrypted in RAM and node was compromised, that instance is exposed
- **Screenshots/copies**: If a human copied the text manually, crypto can't help
- **Key availability**: Your node must be reachable for others to read (mitigate with escrow)

### Summary

Cryptographic revocation provides **mathematical certainty** that revoked content is inaccessible. It doesn't require trust in other nodes' compliance—the laws of cryptography enforce it.

```
You don't ask "please delete this."
You delete the key.
The content dies everywhere, forever.
```

---

## Honest Limitations

### What Cryptography Cannot Do

**Cryptographic revocation guarantees that *unaccessed* copies become unreadable. It cannot retroactively un-read something a human or node already decrypted.**

No technology can solve this. If someone decrypted your lesson while they had key access and saved the plaintext, they have it forever. This is physics, not a bug.

```
The Analog Hole:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Encrypted lesson ──► Decrypted in RAM      │
│                            │                │
│                            ▼                │
│                    ┌───────────────┐        │
│                    │ Copy/paste    │        │
│                    │ Screenshot    │        │
│                    │ Save to file  │        │
│                    │ Write it down │        │
│                    └───────────────┘        │
│                            │                │
│                            ▼                │
│                     Plaintext copy          │
│                  (crypto can't help)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What We CAN Guarantee

| Scenario | Protection |
|----------|------------|
| Content never accessed before revoke | ✅ Permanently unreadable |
| Backups, logs, archives (encrypted) | ✅ Permanently unreadable |
| Compliant nodes that cached | ✅ Will delete, can't re-fetch key |
| Node that decrypted but didn't save plaintext | ✅ Can't re-decrypt |
| Node that saved decrypted plaintext | ❌ They have it |
| Human who copy/pasted | ❌ They have it |

### Mitigation Strategies

Since we can't prevent determined bad actors, we minimize exposure:

1. **Trust graph limits access**
   - Only trusted nodes can fetch keys
   - Fewer decryptions = fewer potential leaks

2. **Audit trail**
   - Log who fetched which keys
   - You know who *could* have the plaintext

3. **Reputation system**
   - Leak content? Get blacklisted network-wide
   - Social/economic consequences

4. **Time-limited access**
   - Keys can have short TTLs
   - Reduces window of exposure

5. **Legal/social layer**
   - Terms of service
   - Community norms
   - "Don't be a jerk" still matters

### The Right Mental Model

Think of cryptographic revocation like a **self-destructing message**:

- It works perfectly against passive threats (backups, forensics, archives)
- It works well against lazy threats (compliant nodes, casual users)
- It raises the bar significantly against active threats
- It cannot defeat a determined adversary with a camera

**This is still valuable.** Most data leaks aren't from determined adversaries—they're from forgotten backups, old logs, and systems that never got the memo to delete. Crypto handles all of those perfectly.

### Summary

> We are honest about our limits because security through obscurity is no security at all.
>
> Cryptographic revocation is powerful. It is not magic.
>
> Use it to protect against the 99% of threats it defeats, not the 1% it can't.
