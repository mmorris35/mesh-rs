# MESH Protocol Specification

> **Memory Exchange & Sharing Hub** — v0.1 Draft

## Abstract

MESH defines a secure, decentralized protocol for federating AMP (Agent Memory Protocol) nodes. It enables selective sharing of knowledge across a network of trusted peers while maintaining strong cryptographic guarantees for authenticity, integrity, and revocability.

### Scope (v1)

MESH v1 federates **lessons and checkpoints**. Code chunks are not shared across the network.

- **Lessons** — Shareable. Signed, published, searchable across the federation.
- **Checkpoints** — Shareable. Signed, published. Enables collaborative context sharing and session handoff between agents/nodes.
- **Code chunks** — Local only. Code hosting and sharing is handled by existing systems (GitHub, Forgejo, etc.). MESH is not a version control system.

AMP implementations MAY store all three locally. MESH operates on lessons and checkpoints.

---

## 1. Node Identity

### 1.1 Keypair Generation

Every MESH node MUST have a long-term identity keypair:

```
Algorithm: Ed25519
Key size: 256 bits (32 bytes)
```

Generation (pseudocode):
```python
private_key = random_bytes(32)
public_key = ed25519_derive_public(private_key)
node_id = base58_encode(public_key)
fingerprint = sha256(public_key).hex()[:16]
```

### 1.2 Node Identity Document

Nodes publish an identity document at a well-known endpoint:

```
GET /.well-known/mesh/identity
```

Response:
```json
{
  "version": "mesh/1.0",
  "nodeId": "12D3KooW...",
  "publicKey": "base64_encoded_ed25519_public_key",
  "endpoints": {
    "mesh": "https://amp.example.com/mesh",
    "amp": "https://amp.example.com/amp"
  },
  "capabilities": ["search", "sync", "directory"],
  "signature": "base64_encoded_self_signature"
}
```

The identity document MUST be self-signed to prove key possession.

---

## 2. Signed Lessons

### 2.1 Signature Format

All shared lessons MUST be signed:

```typescript
interface SignedLesson {
  // The AMP lesson content
  lesson: {
    id: string;
    type: string;
    title?: string;
    content: string;
    tags?: string[];
    severity?: string;
    created_at: number;
    // ... other AMP fields
  };
  
  // Publication metadata
  publication: {
    visibility: "unlisted" | "public";
    publishedAt: number;
    topics?: string[];      // Optional categorization
  };
  
  // Cryptographic signature
  signature: {
    algorithm: "ed25519";
    nodeId: string;         // Publisher's node ID
    publicKey: string;      // Base64 Ed25519 public key
    timestamp: number;      // Signing timestamp (Unix ms)
    sig: string;            // Base64 signature
  };
}
```

### 2.2 Signing Process

1. Construct the signable payload:
```typescript
const payload = {
  lesson: lesson,
  publication: publication,
  timestamp: Date.now()
};
const canonical = canonicalize(payload); // RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization
```

2. Sign with Ed25519:
```typescript
const signature = ed25519_sign(private_key, canonical);
```

3. Attach signature to produce SignedLesson.

### 2.3 Verification Process

1. Extract `lesson`, `publication`, and `signature.timestamp`
2. Reconstruct canonical payload
3. Verify signature against payload using `signature.publicKey`
4. Verify `signature.nodeId` matches `base58(signature.publicKey)`
5. Verify timestamp is within acceptable window (e.g., ±1 hour of current time for new, any past time for sync)
6. Optionally verify trust path to signer

### 2.4 Signed Checkpoints

Checkpoints can also be published to the network. They follow the same signing model as lessons:

```typescript
interface SignedCheckpoint {
  // The AMP checkpoint content
  checkpoint: {
    id: string;
    agent: string;
    working_on: string;
    state: object;             // Decisions, flags, file paths, next steps
    tools_used?: string[];
    problems_encountered?: string[];
    solutions_found?: string[];
    outcome?: "success" | "failure" | "partial";
    created_at: number;
    // ... other AMP fields
  };

  // Publication metadata (same structure as lessons)
  publication: {
    visibility: "unlisted" | "public";
    publishedAt: number;
    topics?: string[];
  };

  // Cryptographic signature (same structure as lessons)
  signature: {
    algorithm: "ed25519";
    nodeId: string;
    publicKey: string;
    timestamp: number;
    sig: string;
  };
}
```

Signing and verification follow the same process as Section 2.2 and 2.3. Substitute `checkpoint` for `lesson` in the payload construction.

### 2.5 Field Extensibility

AMP implementations MAY include additional fields in lesson and checkpoint objects beyond those defined in this specification (e.g., `solved_problem`, `used_tools`, `related_concepts` for knowledge graph integration).

**Signing rule:** Canonical JSON (RFC 8785) serialization for signing MUST include **all fields present** in the record object, including implementation-specific fields. This ensures that additional fields are covered by the signature and cannot be tampered with.

**Interoperability rule:** MESH nodes MUST ignore record fields they do not recognize. Unknown fields MUST be preserved when re-announcing or syncing records to other peers.

### 2.6 Graph Metadata

AMP implementations with knowledge graph features (e.g., amp-rs, nellie-rs) may include structured metadata in lessons and checkpoints:

```typescript
// Optional graph fields on lessons
{
  solved_problem?: string;     // What problem this lesson addresses
  used_tools?: string[];       // Tools involved
  related_concepts?: string[]; // Related concepts
}

// Optional graph fields on checkpoints
{
  tools_used?: string[];           // Tools used this session
  problems_encountered?: string[]; // Problems hit
  solutions_found?: string[];      // What worked
  outcome?: "success" | "failure" | "partial";
}
```

These fields are transported as part of the signed record. **Graph integration is implementation-defined** — receiving nodes MAY use these fields to enrich their local knowledge graph, or MAY ignore them. MESH does not define a federated graph protocol in v1.

---

## 3. Visibility & Publication

### 3.1 Visibility Levels

| Visibility | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `private` | Never leaves the node. Default for all AMP records. |
| `unlisted` | Shared if requested by ID, not indexed or broadcast. |
| `public` | Indexed by directories, included in federated search. |

### 3.2 Publication Flow

```
amp store lesson|checkpoint (private)
         │
         ▼
mesh publish <id> --type lesson|checkpoint --visibility public
         │
         ├─► Sign record with node key
         │
         ├─► Announce to connected peers
         │
         └─► Submit to known directories
```

### 3.3 Announcement Message

When a record is published, nodes announce to peers:

```typescript
interface PublicationAnnouncement {
  type: "publication";
  recordType: "lesson" | "checkpoint";
  signedLesson?: SignedLesson;         // Present when recordType is "lesson"
  signedCheckpoint?: SignedCheckpoint; // Present when recordType is "checkpoint"
}
```

Peers receiving an announcement:
1. Verify signature
2. Check trust path to publisher
3. If trusted: store locally, optionally re-announce to their peers
4. If untrusted: ignore

---

## 4. Revocation

### 4.1 Revocation Record

```typescript
interface Revocation {
  type: "revocation";
  recordType: "lesson" | "checkpoint";
  recordId: string;         // ID of the lesson or checkpoint being revoked
  nodeId: string;           // Must match original publisher
  revokedAt: number;
  reason?: "outdated" | "incorrect" | "private" | "other";
  signature: {
    algorithm: "ed25519";
    publicKey: string;
    sig: string;
  };
}
```

### 4.2 Revocation Rules

1. ONLY the original publisher can revoke (signature must verify with same key)
2. Revocation MUST be propagated like publications
3. Nodes SHOULD delete revoked records from local cache
4. Directories MUST remove revoked records from index
5. Revocation records SHOULD be retained to reject re-announcements

### 4.3 Revocation Propagation

```
mesh revoke <record_id> --type lesson|checkpoint
         │
         ├─► Sign revocation with node key
         │
         ├─► Announce to connected peers
         │
         └─► Submit to known directories
```

---

## 5. Federated Search

### 5.1 Search Request

```typescript
interface SearchRequest {
  type: "search";
  query: string;
  recordTypes?: ("lesson" | "checkpoint")[];  // Filter by record type (default: both)
  filters?: {
    tags?: string[];
    topics?: string[];
    since?: number;         // Unix ms
    nodes?: string[];       // Limit to specific nodes
    agents?: string[];      // Filter checkpoints by agent ID
  };
  limit?: number;           // Default: 20, max: 100
  hops?: number;            // How far to propagate (default: 2)
  requestId: string;        // For deduplication
  origin: string;           // Originating node ID
  ttl: number;              // Remaining hops
}
```

### 5.2 Search Flow

```
You ──search──► Peer A ──search──► Peer A's peers
                  │                      │
                  ▼                      ▼
              local search          local search
                  │                      │
                  ▼                      ▼
              results ◄─────────── results
                  │
                  ▼
         aggregate & return
```

### 5.3 Search Response

```typescript
interface SearchResponse {
  type: "searchResponse";
  requestId: string;
  results: Array<{
    recordType: "lesson" | "checkpoint";
    signedLesson?: SignedLesson;         // Present when recordType is "lesson"
    signedCheckpoint?: SignedCheckpoint; // Present when recordType is "checkpoint"
    score: number;          // Relevance score (0-1)
    trustScore: number;     // Based on trust path
    via?: string;           // Node that provided this result
  }>;
  truncated: boolean;       // More results available
}
```

### 5.4 Result Ranking

Final score = `relevance * trustScore * freshness`

Where:
- `relevance`: Semantic similarity from AMP search
- `trustScore`: 1.0 for direct trust, 0.5 per hop
- `freshness`: Decay function based on age (optional)

---

## 6. Peer Discovery & Directory

### 6.1 Peer Connection

Nodes maintain a set of connected peers:

```typescript
interface PeerConnection {
  nodeId: string;
  endpoint: string;
  trustLevel: "full" | "limited" | "none";
  lastSeen: number;
  connectedSince: number;
}
```

### 6.2 Directory Protocol

Directories index public lessons for discovery.

**Registration:**
```
POST /directory/v1/register
{
  "identity": { /* Node identity document */ },
  "topics": ["rust", "devops", "agents"]
}
```

**Search:**
```
POST /directory/v1/search
{
  "query": "cargo parallel builds",
  "topics": ["rust"],
  "limit": 20
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "results": [ /* SignedLesson[] and/or SignedCheckpoint[] */ ],
  "sources": ["nodeA", "nodeB"],
  "signature": { /* Directory signature */ }
}
```

### 6.3 Directory Federation

Nodes SHOULD connect to multiple directories. Directories MAY sync with each other.

No single directory is authoritative. Results from multiple directories are merged client-side.

---

## 7. Wire Protocol

### 7.1 Transport

MESH uses HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 over TLS 1.3.

**MESH federation requires an HTTP transport.** AMP nodes that only support stdio-based MCP (no HTTP server) can participate locally but cannot join the MESH federation. Implementations intending to federate MUST expose an HTTP server with the endpoints defined below.

Base endpoint: `https://{host}/mesh/v1/`

### 7.2 Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/identity` | GET | Node identity document (also served at `/.well-known/mesh/identity` for discovery) |
| `/announce` | POST | Receive publication/revocation |
| `/search` | POST | Federated search |
| `/sync` | POST | Bulk sync (optional) |
| `/peers` | GET | List connected peers (optional) |

### 7.3 Message Envelope

All messages wrapped in envelope:

```typescript
interface MeshEnvelope {
  version: "mesh/1.0";
  type: string;
  timestamp: number;
  sender: string;           // Node ID
  payload: any;
  signature?: string;       // Optional, required for mutations
}
```

---

## 8. Sync Protocol (Optional)

For nodes that want full or filtered replication:

### 8.1 Sync Request

```typescript
interface SyncRequest {
  type: "syncRequest";
  recordTypes?: ("lesson" | "checkpoint")[];  // Filter by record type (default: both)
  since?: number;           // Records published after this time
  topics?: string[];        // Filter by topics
  cursor?: string;          // Resume token
}
```

### 8.2 Sync Response

```typescript
interface SyncResponse {
  type: "syncResponse";
  lessons: SignedLesson[];
  checkpoints: SignedCheckpoint[];
  revocations: Revocation[];
  cursor: string;           // For resumption (renamed from "checkpoint" to avoid ambiguity)
  hasMore: boolean;
}
```

---

## 9. Error Handling

### 9.1 Error Response

```typescript
interface MeshError {
  error: true;
  code: string;
  message: string;
  details?: any;
}
```

### 9.2 Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Signature verification failed |
| `UNTRUSTED_NODE` | No trust path to sender |
| `UNKNOWN_RECORD` | Requested lesson or checkpoint not found |
| `ALREADY_REVOKED` | Record was already revoked |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests |
| `INVALID_REQUEST` | Malformed request |

---

## 10. Conformance

### 10.1 MUST Requirements

A conformant MESH implementation MUST:

1. Generate and protect Ed25519 identity keypair
2. Sign all outgoing publications and revocations
3. Verify signatures on all incoming records (lessons and checkpoints)
4. Honor visibility levels
5. Process revocations from original publishers
6. Use TLS 1.3+ for all connections
7. Implement `/identity` and `/announce` endpoints
8. Expose an HTTP server (stdio-only nodes cannot federate)

### 10.2 SHOULD Requirements

A conformant MESH implementation SHOULD:

1. Support federated search
2. Connect to multiple directories
3. Implement trust graph with configurable depth
4. Support sync protocol
5. Rate limit incoming requests
6. Log security-relevant events

---

## Appendix A: Canonical JSON

MESH uses RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme) for deterministic serialization before signing.

Key rules:
- Object keys sorted lexicographically
- No whitespace
- Numbers in shortest form
- Strings escaped minimally

---

## Appendix B: Example Messages

### Publish Announcement

```json
{
  "version": "mesh/1.0",
  "type": "publication",
  "timestamp": 1707235200000,
  "sender": "12D3KooWabc...",
  "payload": {
    "recordType": "lesson",
    "signedLesson": {
      "lesson": {
        "id": "lesson_xyz",
        "type": "lesson",
        "title": "Cargo parallel builds crash servers",
        "content": "Never run cargo commands in parallel...",
        "tags": ["rust", "cargo", "build"]
      },
      "publication": {
        "visibility": "public",
        "publishedAt": 1707235200000,
        "topics": ["rust", "devops"]
      },
      "signature": {
        "algorithm": "ed25519",
        "nodeId": "12D3KooWabc...",
        "publicKey": "MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
        "timestamp": 1707235200000,
        "sig": "base64..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 11. Consumer Access (Read-Only)

Not everyone needs to run a node. MESH supports read-only access for consumers who just want to search and learn.

### 11.1 Access Tiers

| Tier | What you run | What you can do |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Consumer** | Nothing (just HTTP client) | Search public content via directories |
| **Reader Node** | Node, no publishing | Above + federated search + trust graph |
| **Full Node** | Node + publishing | Full participation |

### 11.2 Consumer Access via Directory API

Anyone with `curl` can query public knowledge:

```bash
# No node, no identity, no setup
curl -X POST https://directory.example.com/v1/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "cargo parallel builds", "limit": 10}'
```

Response includes signed records. Consumers can verify signatures client-side to confirm authenticity.

### 11.3 What Consumers CAN Do

- Search all public content via directory APIs
- Verify signatures (records are authentic)
- Read public lessons and checkpoints from any node
- Build applications on top of MESH data

### 11.4 What Consumers CANNOT Do

- Participate in federated (peer-to-peer) search
- Access trust-restricted content
- Build trust relationships
- Publish lessons
- Revoke anything

### 11.5 Client Libraries

We encourage client libraries for consumer access:

```python
# Hypothetical Python client
from mesh import MeshClient

client = MeshClient()  # No node, no identity
results = client.search("async rust patterns")

for lesson in results:
    if lesson.verify_signature():
        print(lesson.title, lesson.content)
```

### 11.6 Privacy for Consumers

Consumers querying directories reveal:
- Their IP address
- What they're searching for

Mitigations:
- Use Tor/VPN
- Query multiple directories with partial queries
- Self-host a directory and query locally

### 11.7 Why Allow Anonymous Consumption?

Public knowledge should be publicly accessible. Requiring identity to *read* would:
- Limit adoption
- Create unnecessary barriers
- Contradict the "share knowledge" mission

Publishing requires identity (for attribution, trust, revocation). Reading doesn't.

---

*You don't need to run a node to benefit from MESH. Consuming is free and open.*
